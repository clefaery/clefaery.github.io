            </h2>
            <p>
                Hydro Homies was an academic project focused on designing and developing a product website through html, css and javascript. The product site features a landing page, product pages, shop page, and a checkout page for the Sitting Cuties Hydro Pokémon plush line. I was responsible for designing the interface and visual direction, as well as the development process including responsiveness.

                <p>The first few steps in this project consisted of establishing a strong visual identity for the brand. We ran into a roadblock at first, as we confined ourselves to a style-guide that preceded this project, however, we expanded from that and explored various design concepts to broaden our scope.</p>

                <p>Initially, we presented a pastel coloured minimalist visual identity in our feedback sessions, but we received feedback from the teaching team that it was not a strong art direction that reflected the brand due to its genericness. </p>
                <p>Considering that, we decided to <span class="highlight">move away from this direction completely, in favour for something that aligned with the brand name more.</span> We renamed the company to "HydroHomies" selling hydro Pokemon plushies and I created some water themed graphics and currated a moodboard, exploring the path of wavy ocean themed imagery, playing with various colour palettes.

                <p>One of our main goals was to ensure that all interactive elements are clear that they are meant to be interacted with. For example, buttons need to be clear that they are clickable, and so are image links. I played a role in designing buttons, utilizing drop shadows and vibrant colors to emphasize their interactivity. We intentionally kept buttons and interactive links in a uniform color to provide users with a clear indication of interactive elements. Additionally, I coded and designed various hover and focus states, implementing color changes for buttons and introducing a playful shake effect when users hover over a Pokémon plush in the shop.</p>

                <p>Our team used Github so that we could all collaboratively code and work on it at the same time. I fully coded the product page, and worked on the shop page and checkout page with another team member, where I was responsible for implementing animations, and the grid layout behavior. I was also responsible for creating responsive layouts for each of the pages that I coded, which was done using flexbox and grid.</p>

            <p>Creating a loud and personality first visual identity meant playing a lot with the visual layout of things, but sometimes at the cost of legibility and consequently accessibility. Because of this, one of the main challenges faced was <span class="highlight">balancing the silliness and quirkiness of the story we wanted to tell through this brand’s identity with readability</span> as at the end of the day we want to communicate this content and story as clearly as possible. Another challenge was <span class="highlight">working with the code collaboratively</span> in Github, as this is my first time working on a group project with coding elements. I found it difficult to keep track of what I needed to do and what had been done already, as we ran into issues of various code conflicts when working on the same document.  </p>

            </div>
            <p>Looking back, one of the key things I learned was the importance of <span class="highlight">consistent communication and updates within the group.</span> Given that collaborative coding was a new experience for us, we encountered challenges in tracking changes to files before they were pushed, highlighting the need for precise communication and regular updates. Another thing I learned is that designs <span class="highlight">don't always need to stick with the original art direction</span> all the way through, and not to be afraid of pivoting and starting over. Our team faced struggles in the initial brainstorming as we were confined within one style of minimal, blob like shapes and complimentary colours of orange and purple. After branching out and going back to the drawing board, we were able to explore other visual identities more clearly and found one that aligned with the brand the most. </p>
